3 Anomaly detection and Predictive maintenance for
industrial devices
Complexity degree: 
3.1 Introduction
Nowadays, IoT and Big Data allowed retrieving significant benefits from the devices’
data sensors. Typically in the academic world, this means, the possibility to perform
some analysis as time series forecasting, data predictions, and data classification.
Despite this being extremely useful from the research side, from the enterprise point
of view, the necessities are instead to exploit the huge amounts of data generated by
devices, to perform some predictions for Anomaly detection (AD) and Predictive Maintenance
(PM):
• Anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of rare items, events,
or observations that raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of
the data (Wikipedia Anomaly Detection).
• Predictive maintenance techniques are designed to help determine the condition of
in-service equipment to estimate when maintenance should be performed. (Wikipedia
Predictive Maintenance)
In the light of the above, it’s clear, that both AD and PM are extremely important for a
company to identify possible problems on their devices, anomalies during a production
process, perform maintenance before a fault of a device, or reduce the cost of recurrent
maintenance (that is done even if it is not necessary).
The following project is based on real data taken from sensors of a big company that
operates in the refrigeration field.
